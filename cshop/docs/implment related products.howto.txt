how to enable "Related Products" functionality, briefly
Mon Nov 27 23:04:08 EST 2006

* related products is based around cm_products_relations table.

* in cmProduct.class.php this table is mapped in $child_relations, but control for populating this table is not enabled by default

/config/init.php:
* 1) set config var CSHOP_SHOW_RELATED_PRODUCTS_IN_CART to true to use
* cmCart::fetch_related_products() to fetch products that are related to any in
* the cart. Will be called in cart.php and displayed using
* cart_related_products.tpl

cmProducts.class.php:
* 2) set var $use_related_products = true
     NOTE this should actually be done in a cmProduct subclass, i.e. prgProduct.class.php
     this will cause multi-select for products to show up in the control, that's all.

* 3) Related products will be fetched automatically when cmProduct::fetch() is
* called, and attached to the returned array. Write logic into the controller
* to fetch more detail for each result and pass to template for display.
